# Agentic Design Patterns Documentation

A comprehensive visual and textual documentation of 21 essential agentic design patterns for building intelligent AI systems.

## 📚 What's Included

This repository contains three main types of documentation for each pattern:

### 🔷 Mermaid Diagrams (`/mermaid-diagrams`)
Visual flowcharts in plain English showing how each pattern works, designed to be easily understood without technical jargon.

### 💬 Pattern Discussions (`/pattern-discussion`)
Detailed explanations covering:
- When to use each pattern
- Where it fits in your architecture
- Pros and cons
- Implementation considerations

### 🎨 ASCII Art Diagrams (`/ascii-art`)
Text-based diagrams perfect for copying into Miro boards, documentation, or anywhere that doesn't support rich graphics.

## 🎯 The 21 Patterns

### Strategic Patterns
20. **[Prioritization](./pattern-discussion/prioritization.md)** - Managing task importance
21. **[Exploration and Discovery](./pattern-discussion/exploration-and-discovery.md)** - Finding new solutions

## 🚀 Quick Start

Each pattern includes:
- A visual diagram showing the flow
- Plain English explanations
- Real-world use cases
- Implementation tips

Navigate to any folder to explore the patterns in your preferred format.

## 📖 Source

These patterns are distilled from extensive research on agentic AI systems, made accessible through simple visual representations and clear explanations.
