## When to Use

- **Complex, multi-faceted problems**: Tasks requiring diverse expertise
- **Parallel workstreams**: When subtasks can be handled simultaneously
- **Specialized knowledge requirements**: Different aspects need different skills
- **Scale and efficiency**: Large projects benefiting from division of labor
- **Quality through specialization**: When expertise depth matters
- **Iterative refinement**: Tasks requiring multiple perspectives

## Where It Fits

- **Software development teams**: Design, coding, testing, documentation agents
- **Content production pipelines**: Research, writing, editing, publishing agents
- **Financial analysis**: Data collection, analysis, risk assessment, reporting agents
- **Customer service**: Triage, technical, billing, escalation agents
- **Research projects**: Literature review, experimentation, analysis, synthesis agents

## Pros

- **Specialization benefits**: Each agent optimized for specific tasks
- **Parallel processing**: Multiple agents work simultaneously
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new specialist agents
- **Modularity**: Agents can be developed and updated independently
- **Robustness**: Failure of one agent doesn't crash entire system
- **Knowledge separation**: Clear boundaries between domains
- **Quality improvement**: Multiple perspectives and validation steps

## Cons

- **Coordination complexity**: Managing inter-agent communication is challenging
- **Overhead costs**: Multiple agents mean multiple API calls and resources
- **Context management**: Maintaining shared understanding across agents
- **Debugging difficulty**: Tracing issues across multiple agents
- **Latency accumulation**: Handoffs between agents add delays
- **Conflict resolution**: Agents may disagree or produce incompatible outputs
- **State synchronization**: Keeping shared memory consistent
